NEET Rank Predictor 2025

This project is a simple, browser-based NEET rank predictor tool created for a short-term purpose — to help students estimate their rank based on their score and paper difficulty.

It is not our final vision or goal.

We're building something much bigger and more meaningful, which is currently in progress. This tool is just a small step along the way — a quick resource for students during the NEET 2025 season.

Stay tuned. What we’re really working on is coming soon.
